            <li><strong>Transformed qualitative intuition into a real-time targeting framework</strong><br>
                Mapped emotionally charged events across six major U.S. sports leagues. Designed a trigger system to dispatch custom ad creatives during peak fan emotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Engineered a fan-team affinity model using RFM segmentation</strong><br>
                Improved accuracy of fan identity matching by 32%, complementing user-declared preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Classified live game states using betting data</strong><br>
                Categorized games as Tight, Predictable, or Blowout with 86% accuracy—enabling ad real estate to be priced based on emotional intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Delivered a 50% lift in CTR.

<div class="collapsible-content">
    <div class="education-card">
        <p><strong>Led the introduction of scientific pricing for a major apparel brand.</strong> Collaborated directly with the newly appointed CFO to replace intuition-driven pricing with a data-informed strategy. Revenue was being lost due to inconsistent price-to-demand calibration—pricing too high reduced conversion, while pricing too low compromised margins. A scientific pricing methodology was lacking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Built regression models to quantify price-demand relationships:</strong> Designed and deployed regression models (Elastic Net) for 4 departments and 12 subclasses with 78–84% accuracy to handle high-dimensional inputs and multicollinearity. Applied bootstrapping to quantify confidence intervals for each price recommendation.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolved key operational challenges:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apparel SKUs followed short life cycles and lacked consistent metadata</li>
                    <li>Lifecycle stages (launch, peak, clearance) were undocumented and had to be inferred</li>
                    <li>Promotion data, despite being central to pricing, was unstructured—parsed using NLP and regular expressions to extract usable variables</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Delivered a modular, ML-powered pricing solution that lifted profitability by 16% (~$7.7M). Integrated cleanly with existing pricing engines and was adopted by 6 additional brands without modification.</p>
