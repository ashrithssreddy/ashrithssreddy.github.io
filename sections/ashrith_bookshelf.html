    <h2>Books That Shaped Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a bookworm at heart, with a goal of devouring at least <strong>26 books a year</strong>. For me, reading isn’t just a hobby; it’s like having a coffee chat with the brightest minds from across centuries. Each book I pick up finds its way into my thoughts, actions, and the way I see the world around me. Whether it’s unraveling the mysteries of human psychology, getting lost in the chaos of technological revolutions, or gaining life lessons from trailblazers, every page turns into a stepping stone in my journey.</p>
    
    <p>Books are my <strong>passport to different worlds and eras</strong>. They've helped me embrace new ideas, challenge my beliefs, and sometimes, simply unwind with a hot cup of coffee. If you’re looking for recommendations, start with some of my favorites: <u>Empty Planet</u> (an eye-opener on global demographics), <u>The Signal and the Noise</u> (a masterclass in forecasting), and <u>Made in America by Sam Walton</u> (the gritty, fascinating story of building the Walmart empire). And if you're curious about the complete list of books that have found their way to my bookshelf, check out my Goodreads profile below!</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> My book list is long, so proceed with caution! :)</p>
