    <p>
        I'm driven by technology's potential to create <strong>scalable solutions</strong>. My passion projects stem
        from this passion, allowing me to experiment and explore <strong>emerging fields</strong> like Generative AI,
        Data Engineering and Blockchain. These projects are more than code; theyâ€™re learning experiences to expand my
        skill set and share knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe coding is about solving real-world problems at scale, and my projects reflect this. By transforming
        creative ideas into functional tools, I aim to shape the future of technology and its business applications.
