<!-- 1994: Born :)
2008: Moved to Bangalore (India) in pursuit of better educational opportunities. It was here in Asia's Silicon Valley that I wrote my first line of code, sparking a lifelong fascination with the limitless power of computing.

2020: Amidst the uncertainty of the COVID era, I began my master's degree. While I was already skilled in programming and consulting, I realized that a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind data science was the missing piece in my journey to becoming the best data scientist. This drive to fill that gap pushed me to pursue my master's.
2021: Moving to America brought profound changes, with Florida as the perfect destination for a beach lover like me! I embraced new cultural experiences, developed a deep appreciation for personal freedoms, and rediscovered my love for the beach lifestyle, fostering a renewed sense of balance and independence.
