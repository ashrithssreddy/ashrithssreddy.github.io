<h2>Professional Summary</h2>

<h3>ðŸš€ My Approach to Data Science</h3>

<p><strong>Data only matters if it drives movement.</strong><br>
I focus on building data workflows and narratives that shift teams from gut-feel to informed action.</p>

<p>I'm a Data Scientist with 7 years of experience translating ambiguity into measurable outcomes. I specialize in creating structure where there was noneâ€”helping teams understand what matters, how it's changing, and what to do next.</p>

<p>Across industries like Retail, eCommerce, Media, and SaaS, I've built end-to-end analytics pipelines, developed monetization models, and delivered insights that shaped strategy at scaleâ€”appearing in SEC filings and major publications.</p>
