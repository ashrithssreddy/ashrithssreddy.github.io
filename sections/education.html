        My academic journey began with a <strong>B.S. in Electrical Engineering</strong> at NIT Karnataka, driven by a fascination for technology and its transformative potential. I was intrigued by the intersection of mathematics, programming, and real-world problem-solving. This experience sparked my interest in data analysis and optimization, laying a strong foundation for my analytical and technical skills.

        While the roles of Data Scientist evolved over time, I found a quote back summarizing it well: <em>data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than programmer and more programming than statistician</em>. This reflection coupled wiht my natural curiosity led me to pursue an <strong>M.S. in Statistics</strong> at Florida State University. I wanted to dive deeper into the world of data patterns and statistical models, equipping myself with the analytical tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. This path reflects my desire to use technology to build scalable, data-driven solutions that address real-world challenges.
