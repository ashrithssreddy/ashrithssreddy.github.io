        My academic journey began with a fascination for technology and its transformative potential. I was intrigued by the intersection of mathematics, programming, and real-world problem-solving. This experience sparked my interest in Data Analysis and Engineering
        Optimization, laying a strong foundation for my Analytical and Technical skills.

        While the role of Data Scientist was evolving over time, I found a quote resonating with me back then: <em>A Data Scientist is someone who knows more Statistics than Programmer, and more Programming than Statistician</em>. This reflection coupled with my natural curiosity towards <strong>Applied Sciences</strong> led me to pursue an <strong>M.S. in Statistics</strong>. I wanted to dive deeper into the world of data patterns and statistical models, equipping myself with the analytical tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. This path reflects my desire to use technology to build scalable, data-driven solutions that tackle real-world challenges.
